# WowClassifier
One major problem faced by all machine Learning softwares is the accumulation of test and training data .. It is often very expensive, time consuming and combursome to collect it. And even after a great deal of effort has been put into collecting this data, a great classifier can not be guaranteed. This Classifier greatly reduces this burden by performing classification "on the fly" and dynamically checks the kind of data it requires to improve it's own accuracy ! The classifer works on the principle of multi-level and best of three principle , to sort results into one or more classes. It simultaneously recognizes those classes , for which the accuracy of classification is above or below a pre-defined threshold. As long as a given class's accuracy is below the threshold "T", the classifer keeps demanding training data and test data to improve its accuracy for that class. However, As soon as the accuracy( error component) for a given class reaches above the threshold, it is segregated into a separate bag called the "safe bag". The classes in the safe bag are given less emphasis compared to the "un-safe" classes. test and training data for safe classes are only occasionally and randomly demanded. Un-safe classes are regularly scrutinized anf given much more "training and test data" to improve their accuracy. We continue to perform the above steps until all the classes have reached an accuracy > T.
